RS05MPPI,Cabled Juan de Fuca Mid-Plate,Primary Infrastructure,"Primary Nodes are connected to the land-based shore station in Pacific City, Oregon via fiber-optic cables. These nodes convert high power from the shore station to a lower power and distribute that power and communication to junction boxes along the Juan de Fuca Plate through their science ports. Primary Nodes also receive data and communications from the junction boxes which they transmit back to shore.",,,
