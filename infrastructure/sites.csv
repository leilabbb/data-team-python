LV Nodes convert high power from the primary node to a lower power that can then be distributed LP or MP Jboxes and cabled moorings. LV Nodes cannot directly connect to instruments. LP Jboxes directly connect to instruments and receive power from LV Nodes. LP Jboxes convert power from LV Nodes into the appropriate power for their associated instruments. The MP Jbox can draw power from either a primary node or a LV Node as well as connect directly to instruments and other Jboxes. The MP Jbox converts high power from the primary node to a lower, medium-level power that that can then be distributed to other nodes.",1520,1520,-129.978895,45.92630167
RS03INT2,Cabled Axial Seamount,International District Vent Field 2,"A Junction Box (JBox) rests on the seafloor and is connected to shore via a series of fiber optic cables. Several instruments can be attached to a single Jbox and Jboxes can be connected to each other. Jboxes draw energy from the cables to power instruments and to transmit data from the instruments back to shore. In this way, Jboxes act like both a power strip and a converter. The OOI employs three kinds of Jboxes: Low Voltage (LV) Node, Low-Power (LP) Jbox, and Medium Power (MP) JBox. LV Nodes convert high power from the primary node to a lower power that can then be distributed LP or MP Jboxes and cabled moorings. LV Nodes cannot directly connect to instruments. LP Jboxes directly connect to instruments and receive power from LV Nodes. LP Jboxes convert power from LV Nodes into the appropriate power for their associated instruments. The MP Jbox can draw power from either a primary node or a LV Node as well as connect directly to instruments and other Jboxes. The MP Jbox converts high power from the primary node to a lower, medium-level power that that can then be distributed to other nodes.",1527,1527,-129.9777567,45.925825
RS05MPPI,Cabled Juan de Fuca Mid-Plate,Primary Infrastructure,"Primary Nodes are connected to the land-based shore station in Pacific City, Oregon via fiber-optic cables. These nodes convert high power from the shore station to a lower power and distribute that power and communication to junction boxes along the Juan de Fuca Plate through their science ports. Primary Nodes also receive data and communications from the junction boxes which they transmit back to shore.",2820,2820,,
